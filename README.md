The code "Stochastic Model and ODE model" is used to reproduce the experiment results for simulation(section 5.1 in our paper). By running this code, we could get the 
results in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3,Figure 4.
The code Empirical Study is used to reproduce the experiment results for empirical study using UNOS dataset(section 5.2 in our paper). By running this code, we could get
the results in Figure 5.
When running the code Empirical Study, we need to use the kidpan data. The data is compressed into 7 rar files. To get the kidpan data, first download the 7 rar files, store
them in the same path and don't change the filenames of them, then decompress one of them arbitrarily. By doing this we can get a file "KIDPAN_DATA.DAT", which will be used in the code empirical study.
